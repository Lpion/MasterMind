# Intro

I recently started learning how to code with C++. This is a little learning project i made with some tutorials, and applying my new knowledge.

It is a simple game for the windows console, called Master Mind.

# How to install

Simply download the Source from here, or download the packaged game from http://games.lpion.com.

Download the .zip, extract and thats it. The .exe will be in the folder to start the game. 

# Mastermind

The current Version has its text in-game in german. 

Rules are simple. Guess the 4-color-combination. 

There is a total of 8 colors to choose from, and you have 12 tries.

For each color you guess you will get a white point if its the correct color and place.

A black point for each correct color but in the wrong place. 

Have fun!
